        <div class="card" id="support-groups">
            <h2>Support Groups</h2>
            <h3>Addiction Prevention and Recovery</h3>
            <p>MISSION:  To develop and manage an action plan for St. Stephen which will educate and provide hope for recovery (healing) to individuals and families suffering from the wounds of addiction.  Consistent with the theme of wellness, the plan will also seek to educate members about ways to identify and prevent addictive behaviors.</p>
            <h3>Caregiver Support</h3>
            <p>For those who care for someone else who is sick, disabled, or elderly.  The number of caregivers is steadily growing within our society and congregation.  One contributing factor is that people overall are living longer in conjunction with advancement of medical treatments.</p>
            <p>St. Stephen has identified the growing population and the need for support of caregivers and offers a Caregiver Support Group.  The group typically gathers every other Tuesday, 1:30-3:00 pm at church.  This is an open group and all caregivers are welcome to attend.  The gatherings are facilitated by our Faith Community Nurse.</p>
            <h3>Grief Support</h3>
            <p>Grief is the pain we feel when we lose someone very special to us.  Everyone experiences grief at different times in life.  Too often we grieve silently and alone.</p>
            <p>Fortunately there are resources for help and support.  Because God created us to be in community where we can recieve comfort, support and love, St. Stephen offers opportunities for you and your family as you grieve the loss of a loved one.</p>
            <h3>Wellness & Healing</h3>
            <p>As Children of God we are called to Love the Lord our God with all our heart and soul and might and love our neighbors as ourselves. When we are good stewards of our well-being, we can more easily live out our purpose in God’s creation…loving God and loving our neighbor in our own unique way.</p>
